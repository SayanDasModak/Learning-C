// Area & Perimeter of Rectangle
// Write a program for the following problem

// Letâ€™s consider a rectangle of sides 11 and 13.
// Find and output area of the rectangle having sides as 11 and 13
// Find and output perimeter of the rectangle having side as 11 and 13
// For any rectangle, the formula for area is length * breadth.
// The formula for perimeter is 2 * (length + breadth)

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 11;
    int b = 13;
    printf("%d\n",a*b);
    printf("%d\n", 2*(a+b));
    return 0;
