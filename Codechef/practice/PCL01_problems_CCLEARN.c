// CodeChef Learn Problem Solving In the new CodeChef Learn module, under the "Learn Problem Solving" section, there are two courses for each language. For eg. "Python Beginner - Part 1" and "Python Beginner - Part 2". These courses help you get started with CodeChef contests. Currently there are courses for 4 languages, and hence there are 8 courses in this section. But suppose there are courses for N languages, what will be the total number of courses in this section?
